# How to Run the Tests
    ./node_modules/.bin/cypress run --browser {browser_name} --headless --env configFile=prod
    browser_name = Chrome,Firefox
# How to Open the Test for development
    ./node_modules/.bin/cypress open --env configFile=prod
# How to send report generated from mochaawesome to testrail
    Mochawesome will create a results folder where it will store all the test records in json format (we configure cypress that way)
    node ./utils/reporting/index.js
# How to clean the results folder
    node ./utils/reporting/clean.js
# Building the docker image
    docker build --build-arg RUN_ON_SERVER=prod --tag fuseclassroom .
# Running the test inside container from iamge
    The default behaviour of image is it will run tests when containerized, so we can just destory the container after the test/process completed
    docker run --rm fuseclassroom
# Adding New Tests
    We are going to use simple workflow.

Creating Feature branch Feature Branch workflow

Master should always be clean and runable on anywhere in need.

# Create a branch from master

    git branch branch_name
    git checkout branch_name
    ||
    git checkout -b branch_name
If you use VSCODE then it is much easier with the provided GUI support

# Naming convention of branch name

    test/login
# Adding Each "it" Test Conventions
    The C11405 & C11406 is the testrail's case id, should be always seperated by a | symbol and followup with test tile

describe("Login Test", () => {
  it("C11405| This will always pass", () => {
    cy.log("Test Pass");
  });

  it("C11406| This test will always fail ", () => {
    cy.visit("https://www.facebook.com");
    cy.contains("Error").should("not.exist");
  });
});
